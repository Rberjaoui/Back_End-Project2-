# Environment Setup Guide

This project uses environment variables to securely store database credentials and OAuth2 secrets.

 **Do NOT commit real credentials to GitHub.**

---

## Required Environment Variables

Each developer must configure the following environment variables locally:

### Database (Supabase PostgreSQL)

- DB_URL=
- DB_USER=  
- DB_PASSWORD=

#### Credentials will be provided via communication means (Slack)

---

## How To Set Environment Variables

### Option 1: IntelliJ (Recommended)

1. Go to **Run → Edit Configurations**
2. Select your Spring Boot run configuration
3. Add environment variables in this format:

- DB_URL=...
- DB_USER=...
- DB_PASSWORD=...

4. Save and run.

---

### Option 2: VS Code

If running via terminal:

Mac/Linux:

- export DB_URL="..."
- export DB_USER="postgres"
- export DB_PASSWORD="..."



Windows (PowerShell):

- setx DB_URL "..."
- setx DB_USER "postgres"
- setx DB_PASSWORD "..."



Restart terminal after setting variables.

## Security Rules

- Never commit credentials.
- Deployment platforms (Render/Heroku) must set environment variables in dashboard settings.

If you encounter connection errors:

- Check DB_URL format
- Verify password is correct
- Ensure SSL mode is included
